# Where content goes when it belongs in none of the five

Most of the work of tidying repo documentation is deciding what to *remove*. These are the destinations, roughly in order of how often they come up.

## Delete it

The most common correct answer, and the one people are most reluctant to reach for. Delete when:

- **It's derivable from the codebase in seconds.** Directory trees, dependency lists, file inventories, "the project uses TypeScript and React". An agent runs `ls` or reads `package.json` faster than it reads your description, and gets an answer that's actually current.
- **It's unfalsifiable.** "Write clean, maintainable code." "Follow best practices." "Be mindful of performance." Nobody can point at a diff and say whether it complied, so nothing changes — except that the file got longer and less likely to be read.
- **A tool already enforces it.** A page of formatting rules under a repo with Prettier config is dead weight. Replace with: "Prettier is authoritative; run `pnpm format`."
- **It's stale and nobody can say what the current truth is.** Wrong documentation is worse than absent documentation, because it's trusted. Cut it and flag the gap to the user.

When deleting something non-obvious, say what you removed and why, so the user can push back.

## `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md` — Architecture Decision Records

For *why* a decision was made, what alternatives were rejected, and what the trade-off was. The distinction from `ARCHITECTURE.md` is tense: architecture describes the present, an ADR records a dated decision. That's what lets a decision be superseded by a later ADR without rewriting anything else, and it's why decision history in `ARCHITECTURE.md` makes that file grow without bound.

Minimal shape — context, decision, consequences, status:

```markdown
# 0007. Use Postgres row-level security for tenant isolation

Date: 2026-03-14
Status: Accepted (supersedes 0004)

## Context
<The forces in play. What made this decision necessary.>

## Decision
<What was decided, stated plainly.>

## Consequences
<What this makes easy, what it makes hard, what it commits us to.>
```

## `docs/issues/` and `docs/plans/`

A problem nobody is fixing yet, and work that hasn't been built yet. Neither describes the repository as it is, so neither fits any of the five, and both are awkward in a tracker once agents do the work — an agent reaching a tracker needs a network call and a configured tool, and gets back something it cannot grep.

`docs/issues/` holds one file per problem, moving from `open/` to `closed/` under the same filename. `docs/plans/` holds one phased plan per feature slug, with the facts every session shares in `memory/<slug>.md` and what each run actually did in `reports/<slug>/`.

`references/issues-and-plans.md` has the full structure, when it's warranted, and the templates in `assets/`.

## `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Aimed at people contributing, not at agents mid-task: PR process, commit message convention, review expectations, DCO/CLA, how to get a dev environment up, code of conduct pointer. Overlaps `TESTING.md` and `RELEASE.md` at the edges — cross-link rather than duplicate, and let each fact live in exactly one place.

## `.claude/rules/*.md`

For agent instructions that are genuinely important but only apply to part of the repo. With `paths:` frontmatter they load only when Claude touches matching files, so they cost nothing in sessions that go nowhere near that code:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "migrations/**/*.sql"
---

# Migrations

- Migrations are append-only; never edit an applied migration, add a new one.
- Every migration needs a tested `down`.
```

Rules without `paths:` load every session at the same priority as `CLAUDE.md` — so a rule file with no `paths:` is just `CLAUDE.md` content in a different location, and should be justified on organisation grounds or not split out at all.

## A skill

For a repeatable multi-step procedure — a deployment runbook, a scaffolding workflow, a data migration, an audit. Skills load only when invoked or when their description matches the task, can bundle scripts and templates, and can carry far more detail than any always-loaded file could justify.

Rule of thumb: if you're writing numbered steps into `CLAUDE.md`, it wants to be a skill.

## `docs/runbooks/*.md`

Operational procedures for running systems: incident response, on-call playbooks, scaling, backup and restore. Different audience and different urgency from everything else here, and worth keeping separate for that reason alone.

The boundary with `HOSTING.md` is routine versus emergency. A deploy is routine and belongs in `HOSTING.md`, along with the rollback that follows a bad one; diagnosing an outage at 3am is a runbook. If a procedure runs to numbered steps someone follows under pressure, it wants a runbook or a skill, linked from `HOSTING.md`.

## Module-level `README.md`

How one component works *internally* — its design, its key types, its quirks. Keeps `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the map altitude where it stays stable, while giving detail a home next to the code it describes, where it's most likely to be updated alongside it. Link to it from the component's codemap entry.

## `CLAUDE.local.md`

Personal, project-specific, gitignored. Sandbox URLs, preferred test data, local overrides, individual workflow preferences. If you create one, add it to `.gitignore` in the same change.

Note that a gitignored file only exists in the worktree where it was created. To carry personal instructions across worktrees, import from the home directory instead: `@~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md`.

## `SECURITY.md`

Vulnerability reporting, supported versions, disclosure policy. GitHub surfaces it in the repo's Security tab, which is the main reason to use the conventional filename.

## Never in any document

Secrets, tokens, keys, connection strings with credentials, internal URLs that are only "secret" by obscurity. Reference them by name — `NPM_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL` — and say where they're configured. Anything committed to a repo is permanent in its history, and documentation is the easiest place for a secret to get pasted "temporarily".
